# Arkanoid
A final product of a 5-part-semester project in Java. This project was coded as a five-part ongoing assignment on the Object Orientded Programming course at Bar-Ilan University. 
This project was coded using a single thread. Also, it uses no Java GUI Built-In objects, instead, I used a GUI implementation which is included in this repository.
