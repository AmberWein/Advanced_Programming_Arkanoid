Final product of a 7-part-semester project in Java. This project was coded as a 7-part ongoing assignment on the 2nd semester of my 1st year at BIU. This project was coded using a single thread, which is rare for games such as this. Also, it uses no Java GUI Built-In objects, instead, I used a GUI implementation which is included in this repository.
